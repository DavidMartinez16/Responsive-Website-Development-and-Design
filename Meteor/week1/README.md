Meteor is the web application development framework we will be using in this course. We have chosen Meteor for this course for the following reasons:

Meteor applications are written in Javascript, CSS and HTML, so you do not need to learn another server specific language.

*It uses an adapted version of the handlebars template library that we used in the previous course in this specialisation so you do not need to learn another templating language.
*It provides an easy to install development environment that includes a web server and database server.
*It includes an easy to use packaging system.
*It provides reactive data sources, with a neat distributed data model, meaning your applications will feel really snappy to multiple users.
*Meteor provides free public servers upon which you can deploy your applications for testing and prototyping.
*Meteor includes the capability to generate native iOS and Android apps from the same Javascript code base.
*It implements an isomorphic model which means you run the same code base on the server and the client.
*It runs on top of Node.js and MongoDB and can be deployed on any server that supports these systems.
